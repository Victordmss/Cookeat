# cookeat 
A Flutter application.

## Getting Started
The idea is to create a flutter application allowing any user to have his **own personal recipe management account**. Each user will be able to list his **favorite recipes** :fork_and_knife: on his Cookeat menu. He will also be able to view nutritional and statistical information about his recipes :curry:, ingredients :bread: and food preferences :pizza:. Each user will be able to order a random recipe corresponding to a specific meal (breakfast :coffee:, lunch :hamburger:, dinner :ramen:...)
